The Story So Far

Welcome to the Valley of the Three Keys! There are many legends surrounding
this valley, but none as promising as the tale of the 3 magic keys and  the 
"Door that doesn't belong". This valley is full of caves. Each one has the 
chance to hold one of the magic keys, or your imminent death. Many have 
attempted this quest, but none have returned alive.

You are an adventure, some may even say a treasure hunter. You have headed
out on this quest after overhearing a couple of shady characters in the 
corner of a tavern. It sounded simple enough. Find the 3 keys, open the door,
profit. Of course no one really knows what's behind that door, but you're 
banking on riches. Lots and lots of riches. You have with you a one use first
aid kit, a sharp dagger, and your trusty lockpick. 

Good luck, and try not to die!
